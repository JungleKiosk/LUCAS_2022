                    <p>
                        The elaboration of a working map in Google My Maps
                        it proved to be a great choice. <br> The constant availability of the map directly on my
                        iPhones
                        it significantly simplified my work, saving me time and resources. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, I was able to reduce my ecological footprint thanks to zero paper consumption and in
                        general
                        to optimize my activities.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The optimization of the work took place thanks to the possibility of rapidly iterating the
                        map information, allowing me to make timely decisions and improve efficiency
                        overall. <br>
                        The accessibility and elasticity offered by the work map on my mobile device
                        have contributed to better organization and management of data.
                        Overall, my workflow adoption has been beneficial,
                        leading to greater savings in time, resources and reducing my impact on the environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am satisfied with the results obtained and I highly recommend the use of similar solutions for
                        projects
                        future.
